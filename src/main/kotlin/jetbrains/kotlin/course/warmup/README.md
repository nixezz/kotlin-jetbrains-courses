# Mastermind - Introduction

### Project description
The project of this lesson is Bulls and cows (Mastermind). This is a popular children's game of guessing the hidden word. The main goal of the game is to guess the hidden word. With each attempt, the player receives the number of exact matches (correct letters in the right position) and partial matches (correct letters in the wrong position). For example, with ACEB as the hidden word, the BCDF guess will result in 1 full match (C) and 1 partial match (B).

**The project will be divided into two parts:**

- First, you will create a game prototype that can play with the user but the hidden word will always be the same.
- The second step will be adding a randomly generated hidden word as well as the ability to safely communicate with the user: e.g., handle the user input
